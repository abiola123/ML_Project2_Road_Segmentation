# Project : Road Segmentation

## Introduction

Road segmentation, which is the process of identifying roads on satellite imagery, is part of Image Segmentation. 
This project has been developed in the context of the Machine Learning course CS-433 at EPFL. The aim of this project is to
train a classifier to differentiate roads from background on satellite images.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows:
